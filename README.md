# AuthenticationReduxTest
This is a test project which helped me to learn React, Redux, Express and JWT authentication method

An authentication test project written in React + Redux on the client side and express.js for server side. I did this project after watching a course with the goal of learning React. Itâ€™s a simple project where a user can sign up, sign in and it has one protected route. Everything is stored to a MongoDB database. The method used for authentication is JWT.

# KOA branches
There are 2 Koa branches:

* **Koa 1** - In this branch I've used the Koa 1 framework with generators and promises and a PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM.
* **Koa 2** - In this branch I've used the Koa 2 framework with async/await for asynchronous functions and MongoDB with Mongoose.
