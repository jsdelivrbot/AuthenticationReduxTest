# AuthenticationReduxTest
This is a test project which helped me to learn React, Redux, Express and JWT authentication method

An authentication test project written in React + Redux on the client side and express.js for server side. I did this project after watching a course with the goal of learning React. Itâ€™s a simple project where a user can sign up, sign in and it has one protected route. Everything is stored to a MongoDB database. The method used for authentication is JWT.
